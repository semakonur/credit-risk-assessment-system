# credit-risk-assessment-system
Credit risk prediction and explanation system using ML, SHAP, and LLM-based natural language explanations.

# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI-driven credit risk assessment system.

The goal is to predict the probability of default for credit card customers
and provide clear, human-readable explanations for the risk assessment.

The project combines:

  - Traditional machine learning for credit risk modeling
  - Feature engineering based on payment behavior
  - SHAP for model explainability
  - A Generative AI (LLM) layer to convert model outputs into
    professional, regulation-compliant credit risk explanations

The system is designed to reflect real-world banking practices,
where transparency, interpretability, and responsible AI usage are critical.

# 📌 Key Objectives

  - Build a credit risk prediction model
  - Engineer behavior-based risk features 
  - Explain model decisions using SHAP values 
  - Generate natural language risk explanations using Generative AI
  - Ensure explanations are suitable for credit officers and customers

# 📌 Technologies Used

  - Python
  - Pandas & NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - SHAP
  - OpenAI GPT-4o (for explanation generation)

# 📌 Why This Project Matters

In regulated domains such as banking, models must be interpretable and auditable.
This project shows how predictive models and Generative AI can be combined
responsibly to improve transparency without compromising decision integrity.
